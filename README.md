# Polaris

Polaris is a web application designed for amateur astronomers to upload black
and white images taken with a specific filter and get back a colorful composite
image. While plenty of solutions already exist for this specific purpose, they
are often very expensive or have a relatively high learning curve. Polaris is
meant to be as easy--and free--as possible.
